# Changelog - 2026-02-18

## Frontend Updates

### 1) Default language now follows browser preference

- Added locale detection on root path `/`:
  - First checks local saved preference.
  - Falls back to `navigator.languages` when no saved choice exists.
  - Non-Chinese browsers now default to `/en/`; Chinese browsers stay on `/`.
- Language switch now stores preference locally, so manual user choice is respected.

### 2) Homepage content is richer and better structured

- Added project badges (version, device, license, maintenance state).
- Added concise value points to explain scope and onboarding flow.
- Added a "Latest Updates" block with direct links to newest changelog entries.
- Added metric cards (guide count, script count, changelog count).
- Removed weak labels like "Chinese docs only / English docs only".

### 3) Fixed changelog EN link routing

- Improved internal Markdown link resolution:
  - `changelogs/en/*.md` links are now mapped to `/en/m/...`.
  - Prevents fallback to raw `.md` URLs that caused runtime errors.

## Docs and Changelog Sync

- Updated both index files:
  - `changelogs/README.md`
  - `changelogs/en/README.md`
- Clarified changelog scope: `docs/`, `scripts/`, and `frontend/`.

## Validation

- Frontend build passed (Next.js static export).
- Chinese and English changelog pages now open and switch correctly.
